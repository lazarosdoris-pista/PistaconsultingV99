# Error Analysis - Onboarding Flow

## Error Found: Step 3 → Step 4 Transition

**Error Message:**
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')
at wM (http://localhost:8080/assets/index-DBswaA2D.js:576:34687)
```

**Location:** Step 3 (CRM & Project Selection) → When clicking "Auswahl bestätigen und fortfahren"

**Root Cause:**
The `ProcessAnalysisCRM` component is trying to call `.map()` on undefined arrays when transitioning from process selection to process analysis.

**Affected Component:** `client/src/components/ProcessAnalysisCRM.tsx`

**Issue:**
When the user confirms their CRM and project type selections, the app tries to initialize the ProcessAnalysisCRM component, but it's receiving undefined data for `processes` or `projectTypes`, causing the `.map()` call to fail.

**Fix Required:**
1. Add proper null/undefined checks in ProcessAnalysisCRM component
2. Ensure data is properly passed from ProcessDiagramCRM to ProcessAnalysisCRM
3. Add default empty arrays for processes and projectTypes
